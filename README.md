# What needs to happen this weekend:
(// means done)
- //touch up clubs (//favorites, //data permissions)
- //get photos working (//two functions: 1. save, 2. retrieve image with name)
- implement photos for all data types (general photo class for all photos which gets initialized at home so they don't have to update every time)
- delete photos automatically when not in use
- filters for sports
- teachers connected to firebase (data)
- permissions for teachers (general permissions + individual with email)
- general permissions manager in app (admins can use to manager who can edit general permissions fields)
- variables refreshing when updated to firebase (possibly DispatchQueue.main.async, or related to @State vs. @StateObject)
- make sure it doesn't crash when there's not enough data
- refresh view on homescreen (this one is aiden)
- ui for guest log in (no favorite clubs)
- search for announcements (just implement search bar so you can search inside the text, not the title)
- final ui changes
