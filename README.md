# What needs to happen this weekend:

- touch up clubs (favorites, data permissions)
- get photos working (two functions: 1. save, 2. retrieve image with name)
- implement photos to all data types (when saving, update photo field, when viewing, display image with name from photo field)
- filters for sports
- teachers connected to firebase (data)
- permissions for teachers (general permissions + individual with email)
- general permissions manager in app (admins can use to manager who can edit general permissions fields)
- variables refreshing when updated to firebase (possibly DispatchQueue.main.async, or related to @State vs. @StateObject)
- refresh view on homescreen (this one is aiden)
- ui for guest log in (no favorite clubs)
- search for announcements (just implement search bar so you can search inside the text, not the title)
- final ui changes
