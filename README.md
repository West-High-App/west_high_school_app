what needs to happen (aiden slowass read this shit):
- notifications (aiden) - to figure it out ask for permissions, and make a button that sends a notification. do "if userInfo.loginStatus == "google"" so it only sends to people who are logged in with google (students)
- connecting shit to firebase (august, fuck me bro this shit is hard)
- we're gonna do permissions for who can edit stuff through firebase, not in the app


# West High App
aiden we should do this because it looks professional
